# How to intercept websocket events?

Izabela runs a local websocket server enabling you to intercept different events.
You can use these events to trigger actions in other applications.

Here's an example on [Hyiro](https://twitter.com/HRAK___S2)'s stream with text appearing on screen after sending
messages from
Izabela.

By default, Izabela runs a websocket server on the following address: `ws://localhost:7071`.

Here's a [code sample](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/radical-witty-blanket?path=src%2Fapp.jsx%3A11%3A49) using the
`message:start` event to trigger an action on the page. Send any message from Izabela and watch the character react!

Here's a list of all the events you can intercept:

| Event           | Payload          | Trigger                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message:load`  | `IzabelaMessage` | Triggered when a message started loading                                    |
| `message:start` | `IzabelaMessage` | Triggered when the audio for a message started playing                      |
| `message:end`   | `IzabelaMessage` | Triggered when the audio for a message stopped playing or an error occurred |
| `message:error` | `IzabelaMessage` | Triggered when an error occurred                                            |

I recommend working with [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client) to intercept these events.
