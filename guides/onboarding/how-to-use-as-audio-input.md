# How to use Izabela as an audio input?

Izabela can be used as an audio input on any application that can receive audio inputs.

You only need 2 things to make this work:

- A virtual audio cable installed
- The virtual audio cable configured as an audio output in Izabela

## Install a virtual audio cable from Izabela

> You can skip this step if you already have a virtual audio cable installed.

You can install a virtual audio cable directly from Izabela in the settings.

> Izabela uses [VB-Audio virtual cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) as preferred virtual audio cable.

- Go to `Settings`
- Go to the `Audio` tab under `Speech`
- Under "Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable", click on the "Install" button to launch the installer

> **Note:** A restart is required after installing the virtual audio cable.

## Or install a virtual audio cable manually

> You can skip this step if you already have a virtual audio cable installed.

If for some reasons you can't install the virtual audio cable from Izabela you can still install the audio cable
manually from the official [VB-Audio website](https://vb-audio.com/index.htm).

- Visit the [VB-Audio virtual cable page](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) and download the latest version of the
  virtual
  audio cable
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Run the installer as **ADMINISTRATOR** (`VBCable_Setup_x64.exe` for 64-bit systems or `VBCable_Setup.exe` for 32-bit
  systems)
- Follow the instructions on the installer
- Once installed, go to `Settings` in Izabela
- Go to the `Audio` tab under `Speech` and you should see the message "Virtual audio cable found" under "Install
  VB-Audio Virtual Cable"

## Select the virtual audio cable

- Select the virtual audio cable as an audio output in Izabela

- Then in any application that accepts audio inputs, select the virtual audio cable as an audio input

If all the steps above were followed correctly, you should be able to see audio being sent to the target application
after sending a message from Izabela.
